    "\n",
    "This workshop aims at generating Land Surface Temperature (LST) and other relevant products (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index,surface emissivity, and  fractional vegetation cover) for assessing urban climates (urban heat islands) from Landsat 8 imagery using open python geospatial tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the city of Tallinn, Estonia's capital as our area of study. The image acquisition date is 27.07.2018, this day\n",
    "is one of the series of days in the heatwave of 2018. LST is a widely used parameter to assess the impacts of heatwaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LST is the radiative skin temperature of the land surface. It is estimated from Top-of-Atmosphere brightness temperatures from the thermal bands of remote sensing imagery.Its estimation further depends on the surface albedo, the vegetation cover and the soil moisture.-- **Copernicus Global Land Services**\n",

    "Several algorithms exist for calculating LST from remote sensing images, examples are split-window, dual-angle, and single channel.\n",
